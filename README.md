# Exanvub

Welcome to the GitHub organization page for **Exanvub**, the Department of Experimental Anatomy. Our research group is dedicated to fundamental research in topographical, functional, and clinical anatomy, with a primary focus on the human body and its composition.

## Research Lines

The EXAN research department is structured into three distinct research lines, each with its own areas of expertise:

### 1. Joint Kinematics Research Line

This research line explores the internal motion mechanisms within human joints, with a particular emphasis on segmental and regional kinematics of the cervical spine. We collaborate with national and international institutions, including ULB (Université Libre de Bruxelles - LABO), Università Degli Studii di Genova (Italy), and SOMT (Netherlands), to advance our understanding of joint kinematics.

### 2. Body Composition Research Line

The body composition research line consists of two sublines, focusing on methodological aspects and clinical applications of body composition (BC) techniques, respectively. Our collaboration network extends to national partners such as GERO-VUB and Novartis, as well as international groups like the Pennington Biomedical Research Centre (US) and Hanzehogeschool (Netherlands). Together, we aim to assess muscle quality and quantity, contributing to the field of functional body composition research.

### 3. Functional Musculoskeletal Anatomy Research Line

The third research line addresses anatomical questions that arise from the clinical field, with a specific focus on anatomical variation and its clinical relevance. Our collaboration with SOMT (Amersfoort, Netherlands) allows us to study the clinical implications of anatomical variability, thereby enhancing our understanding of functional musculoskeletal anatomy.

## Future Directions

While expanding our organization, we remain committed to our core strength, the study of macroscopic anatomy. Going forward, we have outlined the following objectives for each research line:

- **Joint Kinematics Research Line**: We will leverage our collaboration network to deepen our understanding of cervical spine kinematics, ensuring continued advancements in this field.

- **Body Composition Research Line**: Collaborating with national and international partners, we will further investigate muscle quality and quantity assessment, contributing to the understanding of functional body composition.

- **Functional Musculoskeletal Anatomy Research Line**: By focusing on anatomical variability and its clinical relevance, in cooperation with SOMT, we will uncover new insights that have practical applications in the clinical setting.
