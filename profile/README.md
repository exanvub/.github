# Exanvub

Welcome to the GitHub organization page for **Exanvub**, the Department of Experimental Anatomy at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB). Our research group is dedicated to fundamental research in topographical, functional, and clinical anatomy, with a primary focus on the human body and its composition.

## Research Lines

The EXAN research department is structured into three distinct research lines, each with its own areas of expertise:

### 1. Joint Kinematics Research Line

This research line explores the internal motion mechanisms within human joints, with a particular emphasis on segmental and regional kinematics of the cervical spine. We collaborate with national and international institutions, including ULB (Université Libre de Bruxelles - LABO), Università Degli Studii di Genova (Italy), and SOMT (Netherlands), to advance our understanding of joint kinematics.

### 2. Body Composition Research Line

The body composition research line consists of two sublines, focusing on methodological aspects and clinical applications of body composition (BC) techniques, respectively. Our collaboration network extends to national partners such as GERO-VUB and Novartis, as well as international groups like the Pennington Biomedical Research Centre (US) and Hanzehogeschool (Netherlands). Together, we aim to assess muscle quality and quantity, contributing to the field of functional body composition research.

### 3. Functional Musculoskeletal Anatomy Research Line

The third research line addresses anatomical questions that arise from the clinical field, with a specific focus on anatomical variation and its clinical relevance. Our collaboration with SOMT (Amersfoort, Netherlands) allows us to study the clinical implications of anatomical variability, thereby enhancing our understanding of functional musculoskeletal anatomy.
